# Oracle Instrumentation Console

    .___.
    {o,o}   An instrumentation tool for Oracle developers
    /)__)   focused on easy installation and usage
    -"-"-   combined with nice features.

*This is currently version 1.2.1. Feedback and help is welcome.*

## Easy to Install

- Works without a context.
- Has a single installation script (can be installed in APEX via "SQL Workshop >
  SQL Scripts").
- If you cannot wait to test it out: Open SQLcl, connect to your desired install
  schema and call
  `@https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ogobrecht/console/main/install/create_console_objects.sql`.
  After some seconds you should be ready to go...
- Docs: [Installation](docs/installation.md),
  [uninstallation](docs/uninstallation.md).

## Easy to Use

- Save to run in production without further configuration
  - Errors are always logged.
  - You can change the default log level for all or specfic sessions from
    `error` to `warning`, `info`, `debug` and `trace`. As a best practice the
    last two should not be set for all sessions on production systems.
  - Specific sessions are identified by the client identifier. If a session has
    no client identifier, console is setting one for you.
- Method names are inspired by the [JavaScript Console
  API](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/api).
  Also see the [API overview](docs/api-overview.md).
- Read more in the [introduction](docs/introduction.md).

## Nice Features

- Can help you to avoid cluttered error logs by only logging errors in your
  outermost package methods without loosing context details with the help of
  [console.error_save_stack](docs/package-console.md#procedure-error_save_stack)
  in the nested methods. This might be the most powerful feature for some
  people...
- No need to provide manually a scope for your log entries - console does this
  automatically for you. If needed, you can overwrite the default scope.
- Has an optional [APEX error handling
  function](docs/package-console.md#function-apex_error_handling) to log also
  internal errors of the APEX engine.
- Has an optional [APEX plug-in](install/apex_plugin.sql) to log JavaScript
  errors in your client frontends. If you use other frontend technologies then
  have a look at the [JavScript sources for the APEX
  plug-in](sources/apex_plugin_console.js) as a template for an own
  implementation.
- Is extensible. Log methods `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug` and `trace` are
  all implemented as a procedure and a function returning the log ID. So you can
  easily implement additional functionality which references the log entries
  like an approval for certain errors or save additional information in a
  specific table.
- Can easily log method parameters with the help of
  [console.add_param](docs/package-console.md#procedure-add_param)
- Brings some useful helper functions - have a look at the [API
  overview](docs/api-overview.md).
